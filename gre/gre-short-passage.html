<p>The speaker’s attempt to <a id="Embellish" href="gre-word-list.html#Embellish"><strong>embellish</strong></a> the facts only served to confuse the audience, as he began to <a id="Meander" href="gre-word-list.html#Meander"><strong>meander</strong></a> through irrelevant anecdotes. In contrast, his opponent’s argument was both <a id="Cerebral" href="gre-word-list.html#Cerebral"><strong>cerebral</strong></a> and <a id="Cogent" href="gre-word-list.html#Cogent"><strong>cogent</strong></a>, supported by data and a clear logical structure.

Her <a id="Dispassionate" href="gre-word-list.html#Dispassionate"><strong>dispassionate</strong></a> tone contrasted sharply with his tendency to <a id="Belittle" href="gre-word-list.html#Belittle"><strong>belittle</strong></a> opposing views. In a move to <a id="Preempt" href="gre-word-list.html#Preempt"><strong>preempt</strong></a> criticism, she addressed the weaknesses in her proposal openly, avoiding the kind of <a id="Duplicity" href="gre-word-list.html#Duplicity"><strong>duplicity</strong></a> that had undermined earlier debates.</p>

The choice to feature an <a id="Anomalous" href="gre-word-list.html#Anomalous"><strong>anomalous</strong></a> piece—a digital sculpture made entirely of sound—was seen by some as an <a id="Aberration" href="gre-word-list.html#Aberration"><strong>aberration</strong></a>.

<p>As the storm grew more <a id="Inclement" href="gre-word-list.html#Inclement"><strong>inclement</strong></a>, officials moved quickly to <a id="Avert" href="gre-word-list.html#Avert"><strong>avert</strong></a> disaster by evacuating the area.

<p>His career had finally reached its <a id="Summit" href="gre-word-list.html#Summit"><strong>summit</strong></a>, a pinnacle of achievement few in his field could rival. But success did not make him complacent. While others might indulge, he maintained a <a id="Spartan" href="gre-word-list.html#Spartan"><strong>spartan</strong></a> lifestyle, eschewing luxury for discipline. A sudden scandal emerged, yet he remained untouched, his character long considered <a id="Unimpeachable" href="gre-word-list.html#Unimpeachable"><strong>unimpeachable</strong></a>. In the face of public frenzy, where commentators <a id="Maunder" href="gre-word-list.html#Maunder"><strong>maundered</strong></a> endlessly with little substance, he took quiet but firm action. Though the crisis was an <a id="Anomaly" href="gre-word-list.html#Anomaly"><strong>anomaly</strong></a> in an otherwise smooth trajectory, his <a id="Resolve" href="gre-word-list.html#Resolve"><strong>resolve</strong></a> never faltered.

<p>She tried to <a id="Equivocate" href="gre-word-list.html#Equivocate"><strong>equivocate</strong></a> during the interview, dodging questions about her controversial report, but the panel wasn’t fooled.

<p>Launched in 1990, the Hubble Space Telescope marked a revolutionary shift in astronomy, offering a level of detail previously thought unattainable. Despite initial setbacks—including an <a id="Anemic" href="gre-word-list.html#Anemic"><strong>anemic</strong></a> start due to a flawed mirror—subsequent repairs transformed it into one of science’s most <a id="Estimable" href="gre-word-list.html#Estimable"><strong>estimable</strong></a> tools. The <a id="Fete" href="gre-word-list.html#Fete"><strong>fete</strong></a> surrounding its discoveries was well-deserved, from capturing distant galaxies to providing data that challenged cosmic expansion theories.

<p>The Eiffel Tower, an iconic structure in Paris, is a <a id="Conspicuous" href="gre-word-list.html#Conspicuous"><strong>conspicuous</strong></a> symbol of French ingenuity and engineering prowess, towering over the city. However, its original reception was less than <a id="Amiable" href="gre-word-list.html#Amiable"><strong>amiable</strong></a>, with many critics <a id="Confound" href="gre-word-list.html#Confound"><strong>confounding</strong></a> its design with disdain, calling it an eyesore. Despite these critiques, the tower has become so synonymous with Paris that it’s nearly impossible to <a id="Differentiate" href="gre-word-list.html#Differentiate"><strong>differentiate</strong></a> the city from the monument itself. In its early years, some even considered the structure an <a id="Apostate" href="gre-word-list.html#Apostate"><strong>apostate</strong></a> against traditional French architecture, marking a departure from classical styles. Yet, through the years, it has emerged as a <a id="Sedulous" href="gre-word-list.html#Sedulous"><strong>sedulous</strong></a> testament to progress, overcoming early disparagements. Like a <a id="Hound" href="gre-word-list.html#Hound"><strong>hound</strong></a> relentlessly pursuing its goal, the Eiffel Tower rose to prominence, its critics unable to <a id="Arrogate" href="gre-word-list.html#Arrogate"><strong>arrogate</strong></a> its position as a cultural landmark.

<p>The Amazon Rainforest, often referred to as the “lungs of the Earth,” is a vast and diverse ecosystem that spans across nine countries in South America. Its ecological importance is <a id="Impregnable" href="gre-word-list.html#Impregnable"><strong>impregnable</strong></a>, playing a crucial role in regulating the global climate by absorbing large amounts of carbon dioxide. However, human activity, such as deforestation, continues to <a id="Exasperate" href="gre-word-list.html#Exasperate"><strong>exasperate</strong></a> conservation efforts, as the forest’s delicate balance is being disrupted. To <a id="Disabuse" href="gre-word-list.html#Disabuse"><strong>disabuse</strong></a> those who think that the Amazon is invulnerable, it is important to note that its survival is increasingly under threat. While some <a id="Espouse" href="gre-word-list.html#Espouse"><strong>espouse</strong></a> the idea of economic development over environmental concerns, many environmentalists argue that the future of the Earth hinges on preserving this irreplaceable resource. The Amazon also has a <a id="Forthcoming" href="gre-word-list.html#Forthcoming"><strong>forthcoming</strong></a> role in scientific discoveries, with ongoing research revealing new species and medicinal plants. Despite challenges, the Amazon remains a <a id="Thoroughgoing" href="gre-word-list.html#Thoroughgoing"><strong>thoroughgoing</strong></a> testament to the Earth’s natural beauty and resilience, and efforts to protect it have been gaining momentum globally. The region’s indigenous peoples, although <a id="Diffident" href="gre-word-list.html#Diffident"><strong>diffident</strong></a> about outsiders, have long been protectors of the forest, offering valuable knowledge on sustainable living. As the world faces environmental crises, the Amazon serves as a <a id="Audacious" href="gre-word-list.html#Audacious"><strong>audacious</strong></a> reminder of nature’s grandeur and fragility.
