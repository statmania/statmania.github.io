# About GRE {-}

[As per the ETS](https://www.ets.org/gre/test-takers/general-test/prepare/content.html),

The GRE General Test closely reflects the kind of thinking you’ll do in today's demanding graduate school programs, including business and law. It measures your verbal reasoning, quantitative reasoning, critical thinking and analytical writing skills — skills that have been developed over a long period of time and aren’t related to a specific field of study but are important for all.


### Test sections and timing (beginning September 22, 2023) {-#test-sections}
