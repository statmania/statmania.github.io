## Day 01

### Set 01

<a id="Desiccated" href="gre-word-list.html#Desiccated">Desiccated</a>, Proselytize, Pellucid, Gumption, Bridle

**[Desiccated](## "Thoroughly dried out; lacking moisture"), [Proselytize](## "To attempt to convert someone to a particular belief or faith"), [Pellucid](## "Clear, transparent, or easily understood"), [Gumption](## "Courage, initiative, or resourcefulness"), [Bridle](## "To restrain or control, especially in a way that limits freedom")**

Once a vibrant speaker brimming with **gumption**, the philosopher's recent lectures have become **desiccated**, drained of the vitality that once drew crowds. Though his ideas remain **pellucid**—remarkably clear and logically coherent—his tendency to **proselytize** rather than persuade has begun to alienate his audience. Many now **bridle** at his dogmatic tone, feeling more lectured at than engaged, as if intellectual dialogue had given way to moral sermonizing.

### Set 02

**[Unimpeachable](## "Unable to be doubted, criticized, or questioned; flawless"), [Enormity](## "The great seriousness or scale of something, especially a problem or crime"), [Self-effacing](## "Modest or humble, not seeking attention for oneself"), [Coterminous](## "Having the same boundaries or extent in time or space"), [Elegiac](## "Expressing sorrow or mourning, often in a poetic manner")**

The professor, known for his *unimpeachable* reputation and *self-effacing* demeanor, delivered a lecture that was both *elegiac* in tone and intellectually invigorating. Reflecting on the *enormity* of historical tragedies, he reminded the audience that academic inquiry and moral responsibility are often *coterminous*—sharing boundaries in both scope and purpose. Though his insights were profound, he never sought praise, preferring instead to highlight the contributions of others, a trait that only deepened respect for his *unimpeachable* character.

### Set 03

**[Conflagration](## "A large destructive fire, often one that spreads quickly"), [Unassailable](## "Unable to be attacked, questioned, or defeated"), [Impervious](## "Not allowing something to pass through or be affected by"), [Appropriate](## "To take something for one's own use, often without permission; suitable or fitting for a particular situation"), [Malingerer](## "A person who pretends to be ill or incapacitated to avoid work or duty")**

What began as a minor policy dispute soon escalated into a political **conflagration**, engulfing the entire administration in controversy. While some officials scrambled to distance themselves, the press secretary maintained an **unassailable** calm, her statements **impervious** to critique and scrutiny. Meanwhile, critics accused certain members of the cabinet of attempting to **appropriate** the moral high ground, despite their complicit silence during the scandal’s early days. One particularly vocal detractor went so far as to brand the deputy minister a **malingerer**, suggesting he had feigned illness to avoid public accountability during the height of the crisis.

### Set 04

**[Stultify](## "To make someone or something appear foolish or to cause to lose enthusiasm or vitality"), [Internecine](## "Destructive to both sides in a conflict; mutually harmful"), [Hauteur](## "Arrogance or pride, often expressed in a condescending manner"), [Panegyric](## "A speech or piece of writing that praises someone or something highly"), [Pontificate](## "To speak in a pompous or authoritative manner, often without considering others' opinions")**

The boardroom debate, meant to foster collaboration, quickly devolved into an **internecine** clash of egos, with factions tearing into each other's proposals more out of pride than principle. At the center of the conflict stood the CEO, whose **hauteur** alienated even his allies. Rather than mediating, he chose to **pontificate** at length about leadership and vision, offering platitudes instead of solutions. His speech, which he likely envisioned as a **panegyric** to his own legacy, did little to inspire confidence. On the contrary, it served to **stultify** innovation, creating an atmosphere where fresh ideas withered under the weight of condescension and inertia.


### Set 05

<span id="Transmute">Transmute</span>

**[Transmute](## "To change or transform in form, nature, or substance"), [Proscribe](## "To forbid or prohibit, especially by law or authority"), [Turgid](## "Swollen, inflated, or pompous, often used to describe language or writing"), [Dolorous](## "Expressing sorrow or grief; mournful"), [Solicitous](## "Showing concern or care for someone's well-being")**

Despite the artist’s attempt to **transmute** personal grief into something universally resonant, the result was a **turgid** display of self-indulgent melancholy that left critics unimpressed. The exhibition, laden with overwrought symbolism and meandering monologues, was intended to evoke empathy, but instead it alienated its audience. Even the most **solicitous** observers, eager to appreciate the emotional vulnerability on display, found themselves struggling to connect with the work’s **dolorous** tone and lack of clarity. Some cultural commentators went as far as to **proscribe** such artistic expressions, arguing that unfiltered emotional catharsis should not masquerade as profound art.

## Day 02

### Set 01

**[Complaisant](## "Willing to please others; obliging or courteous"), [Mendicant](## "A person who lives by begging or depending on charity"), [Impugn](## "To challenge or attack the truth, integrity, or validity of something"), [Conflate](## "To combine two or more things into one, often inaccurately"), [Obtuse](## "Dull or slow to understand; lacking sharpness or quickness of mind")**

The senator’s **complaisant** aides, always eager to please, rarely challenged his decisions—even when they clearly led to public backlash. In contrast, a lone journalist, once dismissed as a mere **mendicant** for truth, tirelessly investigated the campaign’s finances. When she began to publicly **impugn** the integrity of certain donations, accusing the team of impropriety, the senator deflected, accusing her of trying to **conflate** minor oversights with deliberate fraud. Yet his most **obtuse** move was underestimating the intelligence of the electorate, who saw through the vague defenses and demanded transparency.

### Set 02

**[Vaunted](## "Boasted about or praised excessively, often in an exaggerated manner"), [Palatable](## "Pleasant or acceptable to the taste or mind"), [Tyro](## "A beginner or novice in a particular field or activity"), [Afford](## "To have the financial means to do or buy something; to provide or supply"), [Abjure](## "To renounce or give up something formally, especially a belief or cause")**

The startup's **vaunted** technology, hailed as revolutionary in press releases, turned out to be far less impressive when scrutinized by experts. While the concept was **palatable** to investors—appealing enough to secure funding—it lacked practical application. The lead engineer, a **tyro** fresh out of graduate school, had enthusiasm but little real-world experience. The design, though ambitious, failed to **afford** any real advantage over existing solutions. Eventually, the company was forced to **abjure** its bold claims and revise its goals, publicly distancing itself from its earlier hyperbole.

### Set 03

**[Sardonic](## "Mocking or cynical, often in a scornful manner"), [Oblique](## "Not explicit or straightforward; indirect"), [Canard](## "A false or misleading story or rumor"), [Bereft](## "Deprived of something, especially a loved one or a quality"), [Exiguity](## "The state of being very small or cramped; scarcity or smallness")**

When the documentary on ancient exploration aired, viewers were struck by the narrator’s **sardonic** humor—his dry, almost mocking remarks added unexpected levity to the subject. One segment explored an old **canard** about a lost civilization supposedly buried beneath the ocean, a story long since debunked but still retold with fascination. The archaeologist interviewed gave an **oblique** answer when asked about his belief in the legend, hinting at possibilities without ever stating his view directly. The ruins themselves, **bereft** of any inscriptions or artifacts, offered little to support the myth. The team’s biggest challenge, however, was the **exiguity** of light in the cave—just enough to see, but not enough to photograph anything clearly.

### Set 04

**[Officious](## "Offering unnecessary and unwanted advice or services; meddlesome"), [Obtain](## "To acquire something, especially through effort or means; to be valid or in effect"), [Evanescent](## "Quickly fading or disappearing; fleeting"), [Concomitant](## "Accompanying or happening at the same time as something else, often in a related manner"), [Modicum](## "A small quantity or portion of something, especially a small amount of a quality or feeling")**

The intern’s **officious** behavior—constantly offering unwanted help and inserting herself into every discussion—quickly wore thin with the senior staff. Though her enthusiasm was noted, it wasn’t clear whether her suggestions **obtained** in the current context; many of her ideas, though theoretically sound, didn’t apply to the company’s real-world constraints. Her excitement, while genuine, proved **evanescent**, fading within weeks as the pace of the job caught up with her. Fatigue and frustration soon became **concomitant** with her daily routine, and even a **modicum** of encouragement from supervisors might have helped her stay engaged longer.

### Set 05

**[Pillory](## "A wooden framework with holes for the head and hands, used for public punishment; to subject someone to public ridicule"), [Lachrymose](## "Tearful or given to weeping; sad or sorrowful"), [Veritable](## "Being truly or very much so; used to emphasize a metaphor or description"), [Capitulate](## "To surrender or give in to an opponent or demand, often after negotiation or resistance"), [Despot](## "A ruler with absolute power, often one who exercises it in a tyrannical or oppressive manner")**

Though once hailed as a reformer, the ruler quickly revealed himself to be a **veritable** **despot**, suppressing dissent with a ruthlessness that shocked even his former supporters. Journalists who dared question his policies were publicly **pilloried**, not just figuratively but in broadcasts meant to humiliate and silence. As resistance movements faltered under harsh crackdowns, their leaders were forced to **capitulate**, abandoning their causes in exchange for leniency. The population, weary and disillusioned, grew increasingly **lachrymose**, mourning not only lost freedoms but the betrayal of their hopes.

## Day 03

### Set 01

**[Debauchery](## "Excessive indulgence in sensual pleasures, often leading to moral corruption"), [Exorbitant](## "Unreasonably high or excessive, especially in terms of price or amount"), [Repudiation](## "The rejection or disavowal of something, often a belief, idea, or claim"), [Seasoned](## "Experienced or skilled in a particular field or activity; or flavored with spices"), [Forthright](## "Direct and straightforward in manner; honest and clear")**

The senator’s downfall was precipitated by allegations of prolonged **debauchery**, which sharply contrasted with his once wholesome public image. Critics seized on the opportunity, calling his actions not merely irresponsible but emblematic of the **exorbitant** privileges afforded to those in power. His televised **repudiation** of the claims—though lengthy—struck many as evasive and insincere. In contrast, a more **seasoned** colleague offered a **forthright** assessment of the scandal, acknowledging its validity while calling for a more accountable political culture.

### Set 02

**[Poignant](## "Evoking a strong sense of sadness or regret; emotionally moving"), [Trenchant](## "Sharp, incisive, or forceful in expression or style"), [Egalitarian](## "Believing in or advocating for equal rights and opportunities for all people"), [Ebullient](## "Overflowing with enthusiasm or excitement; bubbly"), [Dissipate](## "To squander or waste something, especially energy, money, or resources")**

The documentary offered a **poignant** look at communities displaced by industrial expansion, its emotional depth accentuated by a **trenchant** critique of unchecked corporate power. While the film advocated for an **egalitarian** approach to resource distribution, its message was delivered with such **ebullient** energy that even the most skeptical viewers were drawn in. Sadly, much of the initial momentum for reform would soon **dissipate**, lost in bureaucratic delays and squandered opportunities for real change.

### Set 03

<a id="Enamored" href="gre-word-list.html#Enamored">Enamored</a>

**[Enamored](## "Filled with love or admiration for someone or something"), [Cataclysm](## "A large-scale and violent event, often causing great destruction or change"), [Loath](## "Reluctant or unwilling to do something; strongly opposed"), [Frivolous](## "Not having serious value or importance; carefree or silly"), [Estimable](## "Worthy of respect or admiration; deserving of esteem")**

Despite being **enamored** with the idea of a career in art, Jane soon realized that her initial enthusiasm was not enough to shield her from the harsh realities of the profession. The financial instability she faced, along with the looming threat of a **cataclysm** in the industry due to new technological changes, made her deeply **loath** to continue pursuing a path that seemed increasingly uncertain. Many of her peers, however, remained committed to what they saw as a noble cause, refusing to be swayed by the **frivolous** distractions that often accompanied fame. Jane, although uncertain, still held her mentor in high regard for being an **estimable** figure who had endured many of the same challenges.


## Set 04

Infelicitous, row, adjudicate, raillery, halcyon

In the midst of the **row** between the two factions, the council convened to **adjudicate** the matter. The dispute, which had begun with **infelicitous** remarks, quickly escalated into heated arguments. Though the atmosphere was initially charged with tension, a few moments of **raillery** from an onlooker lightened the mood, reminding everyone of the more peaceful days, or the **halcyon** period, when such disagreements were rare. However, the council’s task remained clear: to restore order and resolve the conflict without further rancor.

## Passage 05

<a id="Demonstrative" href="gre-word-list.html#Demonstrative">Demonstrative</a>,
<a id="Hoodwink" href="gre-word-list.html#Hoodwink">Hoodwink</a>,
<a id="Eponym" href="gre-word-list.html#Eponym">Eponym</a>,
<a id="Bastardization" href="gre-word-list.html#Bastardization">Bastardization</a>,
<a id="FlagWane" href="gre-word-list.html#FlagWane">Flag (Wane)</a>


The professor was <a id="Demonstrative" href="gre-word-list.html#Demonstrative">demonstrative</a> in his explanations, eager to clarify every concept, but some students still felt <a id="Hoodwink" href="gre-word-list.html#Hoodwink">hoodwinked</a> by the overly complex jargon. The <a id="Eponym" href="gre-word-list.html#Eponym">eponym</a> of the theory, a celebrated mathematician, would likely have disagreed with the <a id="Bastardization" href="gre-word-list.html#Bastardization">bastardization</a> of his original ideas. As the debate continued, it became clear that the excitement surrounding the theory had begun to <a id="Flag" href="gre-word-list.html#Flag">flag</a>, much like the interest in the subject itself.
