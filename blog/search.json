    "text": "A z-score (also known as a standard score or z-value) measures how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean of a distribution. It’s a way of standardizing individual data points so they can be compared, regardless of the scale of the data.\n\nHow to calculate the z-score:\nThe formula for the z-score of a data point is:\n\\(z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\)\nWhere:\n\n\\(X\\) = the value of the data point.\n\\(\\mu\\) = the mean (average) of the dataset.\n\\(\\sigma\\) = the standard deviation of the dataset.\n\n\n\nSteps to calculate the z-score:\n\nFind the mean of the dataset.\nFind the standard deviation of the dataset.\nSubtract the mean from the data point you’re interested in.\nDivide the result by the standard deviation.\n\n\n\nExample:\nImagine you have the following dataset of test scores: [80, 85, 90, 95, 100]\n\nMean (μ): ((80 + 85 + 90 + 95 + 100) / 5 = 90)\nStandard Deviation (σ): Calculate the standard deviation of the dataset (you could use a standard formula or a calculator for this). Let’s say it’s 7.91.\nTo find the z-score for a score of 85:\n\\(z = \\frac{85 - 90}{7.91} \\approx -0.63\\)\nThis means the score of 85 is 0.63 standard deviations below the mean.\n\n\n\n\nCommon uses of the z-score:\n\nStandardizing data: Z-scores are used to standardize data, especially when you want to compare values from different datasets with different units or scales.\nIdentifying outliers: A data point with a z-score greater than +3 or less than -3 is often considered an outlier because it lies more than 3 standard deviations away from the mean.\nProbability and normal distribution: In statistics, z-scores are crucial when working with the normal distribution. They can be used to find the probability of a value occurring within a normal distribution by looking up the z-score in a standard normal distribution table (or using statistical software).\nComparing scores across different distributions: For example, in education, z-scores allow you to compare scores from different tests, even if those tests have different scales (e.g., SAT vs. ACT scores). You can convert raw scores into z-scores to compare relative performance.\nRisk assessment and finance: In finance, z-scores can be used to assess the risk or financial stability of a company. The Altman Z-score, for instance, is used to predict the likelihood of bankruptcy.\nQuality control and manufacturing: In quality control, z-scores help assess whether a product meets specifications, identifying whether the production process is consistent or if corrective action is needed."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Before submitting your R package to CRAN, you should go through a thorough checklist to ensure it meets all the requirements. Failure to meet these standards will result in rejection. The submission process is a manual review, and reviewers are strict about the rules.\n\n\n1. Code Quality and Checks\n\nPass R CMD check --as-cran without any errors, warnings, or notes. This is the most critical step. Run this command from your package’s root directory. Address every single issue.\nNo Hardcoded Paths: Don’t use absolute paths like C:/Users/User/my_file.csv. Use system.file() to locate files within your package.\nNo Non-Standard Library Dependencies: Ensure you are not using libraries that are not on CRAN or Bioconductor.\nPackage Size: CRAN has a size limit, which is typically around 5 MB, though larger packages are sometimes accepted if they are well-justified. Use devtools::check_for_size()\n\n\n\n\n2. Documentation and Metadata\n\nDESCRIPTION File: Ensure this file is complete and accurate.\n\nVersion: The version number should be in the format A.B.C (e.g., 1.0.0).\nTitle: This should be concise and capitalized.\nDescription: A detailed, multi-sentence description of what your package does.\nLicense: Specify a valid open-source license, such as MIT or GPL-3.\nURL and BugReports: Include links to your GitHub repository or website.\nImports: List all packages your code uses.\nSuggests: List packages used in examples or vignettes but not essential for core functionality.\n\nman/ Directory: All functions must have a .Rd help file, and all function arguments should be documented. The examples in the help files should be runnable.\nVignettes: Include at least one vignette (.Rmd file in the vignettes/ directory) that provides a user-friendly introduction to your package’s main features.\nNEWS.md: A file documenting changes between versions is highly recommended.\nREADME File: A comprehensive README.md file in the package’s root directory is standard practice.\n\n\n\n\n3. User Experience and Best Practices\n\nInformative Error Messages: Your functions should provide clear, user-friendly error messages with stop() and warning() when things go wrong.\nAvoid Namespace Pollution: Use :: to call functions from other packages (e.g., ggplot2::ggplot()) unless a package is attached with library(). This prevents conflicts between functions with the same name.\nMinimal Dependencies: Only import packages you absolutely need to.\nUnit Tests: While not strictly required for a first submission, having a comprehensive suite of unit tests using testthat is highly recommended. They protect against regressions in future versions.\nData: If your package includes data, it should be placed in the data/ directory and documented with a .Rd file.\n\n\n\n\n4. Submission\n\ncran-checks: Check your package against the cran-checks GitHub action if you’ve set it up.\ndevtools::submit_cran(): This function from the devtools package automates much of the submission process, including creating the submission email.\nMaintain Patience: The review process can take anywhere from a few days to several weeks. Be ready to respond to reviewer feedback and make necessary changes.\n\n\n\nHadley Recommendation\nThese are the major steps in the release process:\n\nDetermine the release type, which dictates the version number.\nIf the package is already on CRAN: Do due diligence on existing CRAN results. If this is a first release: confirm you are in compliance with CRAN policies.\nFreshen up documentation files, such as README.md and NEWS.md.\nDouble check() that your package is passing cleanly on multiple operating systems and on the released and development version of R.\nPerform reverse dependency checks, if other packages depend on yours.\nSubmit the package to CRAN and wait for acceptance.\nCreate a GitHub release and prepare for the next version by incrementing the version number.\nPublicize the new version."

    "text": "The Interquartile Range (IQR) is a measure of statistical dispersion that describes the spread of the middle 50% of data. It is calculated as:\n\\(\\text{IQR} = Q_3 - Q_1\\)\nwhere \\(Q_1\\) is the 25th percentile and \\(Q_3\\) is the 75th percentile.\n\n\nUsefulness of IQR\n\nRobust to outliers – Unlike the range or standard deviation, the IQR is not influenced by extreme values.\nIdentifies variability of the central portion of the data.\nUsed to detect outliers – Often, values below \\(Q_1 - 1.5 \\times \\text{IQR}\\) or above \\(Q_3 + 1.5 \\times \\text{IQR}\\) are considered outliers.\nHelps in comparing distributions – Especially when using box plots.\n\n\n\n\nExample: Exam Scores\nSuppose the exam scores (out of 100) of 15 students are:\n\\(55, 60, 65, 70, 72, 75, 78, 80, 82, 85, 88, 90, 95, 98, 99\\)\nStep 1: Find \\(Q_1\\) and \\(Q_3\\) - \\(Q_1\\) = median of the first half (excluding overall median if odd) = 70 - \\(Q_3\\) = median of the second half = 90\nStep 2: Calculate IQR\n\\(\\text{IQR} = 90 - 70 = 20\\)\nStep 3: Interpret - The middle 50% of students scored between 70 and 90. - The spread of these central scores is 20 points.\nStep 4: Detect outliers Lower fence: \\(70 - 1.5 \\times 20 = 40\\) Upper fence: \\(90 + 1.5 \\times 20 = 120\\) No scores below 40 or above 120 → No outliers.\n\n\n\nWhy IQR is useful here\n\nIf one student scored 20 instead of 55, the range would change drastically, but the IQR would remain the same.\nIQR gives a clearer picture of the typical spread unaffected by extremes."
