    "title": "CRAN Package Submission Checklist",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Before submitting your R package to CRAN, you should go through a thorough checklist to ensure it meets all the requirements. Failure to meet these standards will result in rejection. The submission process is a manual review, and reviewers are strict about the rules.\n\n\n1. Code Quality and Checks\n\nPass R CMD check --as-cran without any errors, warnings, or notes. This is the most critical step. Run this command from your package’s root directory. Address every single issue.\nNo Hardcoded Paths: Don’t use absolute paths like C:/Users/User/my_file.csv. Use system.file() to locate files within your package.\nNo Non-Standard Library Dependencies: Ensure you are not using libraries that are not on CRAN or Bioconductor.\nPackage Size: CRAN has a size limit, which is typically around 5 MB, though larger packages are sometimes accepted if they are well-justified. Use devtools::check_for_size()\n\n\n\n\n2. Documentation and Metadata\n\nDESCRIPTION File: Ensure this file is complete and accurate.\n\nVersion: The version number should be in the format A.B.C (e.g., 1.0.0).\nTitle: This should be concise and capitalized.\nDescription: A detailed, multi-sentence description of what your package does.\nLicense: Specify a valid open-source license, such as MIT or GPL-3.\nURL and BugReports: Include links to your GitHub repository or website.\nImports: List all packages your code uses.\nSuggests: List packages used in examples or vignettes but not essential for core functionality.\n\nman/ Directory: All functions must have a .Rd help file, and all function arguments should be documented. The examples in the help files should be runnable.\nVignettes: Include at least one vignette (.Rmd file in the vignettes/ directory) that provides a user-friendly introduction to your package’s main features.\nNEWS.md: A file documenting changes between versions is highly recommended.\nREADME File: A comprehensive README.md file in the package’s root directory is standard practice.\n\n\n\n\n3. User Experience and Best Practices\n\nInformative Error Messages: Your functions should provide clear, user-friendly error messages with stop() and warning() when things go wrong.\nAvoid Namespace Pollution: Use :: to call functions from other packages (e.g., ggplot2::ggplot()) unless a package is attached with library(). This prevents conflicts between functions with the same name.\nMinimal Dependencies: Only import packages you absolutely need to.\nUnit Tests: While not strictly required for a first submission, having a comprehensive suite of unit tests using testthat is highly recommended. They protect against regressions in future versions.\nData: If your package includes data, it should be placed in the data/ directory and documented with a .Rd file.\n\n\n\n\n4. Submission\n\ncran-checks: Check your package against the cran-checks GitHub action if you’ve set it up.\ndevtools::submit_cran(): This function from the devtools package automates much of the submission process, including creating the submission email.\nMaintain Patience: The review process can take anywhere from a few days to several weeks. Be ready to respond to reviewer feedback and make necessary changes.\n\n\n\nHadley Recommendation\nThese are the major steps in the release process:\n\nDetermine the release type, which dictates the version number.\nIf the package is already on CRAN: Do due diligence on existing CRAN results. If this is a first release: confirm you are in compliance with CRAN policies.\nFreshen up documentation files, such as README.md and NEWS.md.\nDouble check() that your package is passing cleanly on multiple operating systems and on the released and development version of R.\nPerform reverse dependency checks, if other packages depend on yours.\nSubmit the package to CRAN and wait for acceptance.\nCreate a GitHub release and prepare for the next version by incrementing the version number.\nPublicize the new version."

The length and color of the clock hands can be modified by certain qualitative and quantitative variables.\nAdditionally, the package can make a day chart, a week chart, or a month chart, or plan events in those periods.\nI would like everyone to visit the package website (generated automatically by pkgdown), explore the examples, and give wise advice\nTo see a quick example, see the attached plot. The plot shows times of earthquakes. Points are magnified as per magnitude. Length and color denote the depth of the epicenter. This allows us to find patterns in the event times as well as compare differences in time more easily and usefully than with other charts, such as a bar chart.\n\n\n\nclockplot\n\n\nThose having a github account, please visit the repo and please give a star :)"

    "text": "A z-score (also known as a standard score or z-value) measures how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean of a distribution. It’s a way of standardizing individual data points so they can be compared, regardless of the scale of the data.\n\nHow to calculate the z-score:\nThe formula for the z-score of a data point is:\n\\(z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\)\nWhere:\n\n\\(X\\) = the value of the data point.\n\\(\\mu\\) = the mean (average) of the dataset.\n\\(\\sigma\\) = the standard deviation of the dataset.\n\n\n\nSteps to calculate the z-score:\n\nFind the mean of the dataset.\nFind the standard deviation of the dataset.\nSubtract the mean from the data point you’re interested in.\nDivide the result by the standard deviation.\n\n\n\nExample:\nImagine you have the following dataset of test scores: [80, 85, 90, 95, 100]\n\nMean (μ): ((80 + 85 + 90 + 95 + 100) / 5 = 90)\nStandard Deviation (σ): Calculate the standard deviation of the dataset (you could use a standard formula or a calculator for this). Let’s say it’s 7.91.\nTo find the z-score for a score of 85:\n\\(z = \\frac{85 - 90}{7.91} \\approx -0.63\\)\nThis means the score of 85 is 0.63 standard deviations below the mean.\n\n\n\n\nCommon uses of the z-score:\n\nStandardizing data: Z-scores are used to standardize data, especially when you want to compare values from different datasets with different units or scales.\nIdentifying outliers: A data point with a z-score greater than +3 or less than -3 is often considered an outlier because it lies more than 3 standard deviations away from the mean.\nProbability and normal distribution: In statistics, z-scores are crucial when working with the normal distribution. They can be used to find the probability of a value occurring within a normal distribution by looking up the z-score in a standard normal distribution table (or using statistical software).\nComparing scores across different distributions: For example, in education, z-scores allow you to compare scores from different tests, even if those tests have different scales (e.g., SAT vs. ACT scores). You can convert raw scores into z-scores to compare relative performance.\nRisk assessment and finance: In finance, z-scores can be used to assess the risk or financial stability of a company. The Altman Z-score, for instance, is used to predict the likelihood of bankruptcy.\nQuality control and manufacturing: In quality control, z-scores help assess whether a product meets specifications, identifying whether the production process is consistent or if corrective action is needed."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Super-Sleuth “Chemical Camera”\nImagine you have a tiny painting, and you want to know exactly what it’s made of—not just the colors, but the actual elements (like iron, copper, lead, calcium) in every single brushstroke.\nMicro-XRF is like a super-powered, non-destructive chemical camera. It doesn’t just take a picture of what something looks like; it takes a detailed map of what it’s made of, point by tiny point.\n\n\n\nSimple Breakdown:\n1. The “Micro” Part:\n\nThis is the magnifying glass. The machine uses special optics to focus its X-ray beam down to an incredibly small spot—often as tiny as the width of a human hair or smaller. This lets it scan specific, microscopic areas (like a single mineral grain, a paint chip, or a circuit board trace).\n\n2. The “XRF” Part (X-Ray Fluorescence):\nThis is the elemental detective part. It works in three steps:\n\nStep 1: Zap! The machine fires a focused beam of high-energy X-rays at a tiny spot on your sample.\nStep 2: Excite! When the X-rays hit an atom in the sample, they knock an electron out of its inner shell. This makes the atom unstable.\nStep 3: Shine! To become stable again, an electron from an outer shell drops in to fill the hole. When it does this, it releases a tiny burst of energy in the form of a secondary X-ray. This is the “fluorescence.”\nThe Key: Every chemical element (iron, gold, silicon, etc.) releases a unique, signature X-ray with a specific energy. It’s like each element has its own distinct “fingerprint” color in the X-ray spectrum.\n\n3. Putting It All Together:\nThe machine has a detector that “listens” for these fluorescent X-rays and reads their “fingerprints.” It then moves the beam point-by-point across the sample, building up a map.\nThe result is a set of colorful images where each color shows the distribution and concentration of a specific element across your sample.\n\n\n\nThe Classic Analogy: The Pinball Machine\n\nThe X-ray Beam is like the plunger that launches the pinball (the high-energy X-ray photon).\nThe Sample’s Atoms are the bumpers and targets.\nThe “Fluorescence” is like the specific sound and lights that go off when you hit a particular target. A bell means you hit the Iron target. A siren means you hit the Copper target.\nBy listening to the sounds (detecting the X-rays), you know exactly what targets (elements) you hit and where.\n\n\n\n\nWhat Does the Output Look Like?\nYou get beautiful elemental maps. For example, if you scan an old coin: * One map might show copper (in red) everywhere. * Another map might show tin (in blue) only in certain areas, revealing it’s actually bronze. * Another might show silver (in green) only in the raised design, proving it was silver-plated.\n\n\nKey Features in Simple Terms:\n\nNon-Destructive: It doesn’t hurt the sample. You can scan a priceless painting or a rare meteorite without cutting or damaging it.\nElemental, Not Molecular: It tells you what elements are there (iron, calcium, lead), but not necessarily what compounds they are in (hematite, calcium carbonate, lead white paint). For that, you’d need a partner technique like Raman spectroscopy.\nFrom Major to Trace: It can detect elements from large concentrations down to very tiny traces (parts per million).\n\n\n\nWhere Is It Used?\n\nArt & Archaeology: Is that Picasso genuine? What pigments did ancient Egyptians use?\nGeology: What minerals are in this rock, and how are they zoned?\nMaterials Science: Are there impurities in this solar cell? Is the coating on this metal even?\nBiology/Medicine: Where does iron or calcium accumulate in a piece of bone or a plant leaf?\n\nIn a nutshell: Micro-XRF is a high-tech magnifying glass that zaps tiny spots with X-rays and listens to their unique “elemental song” to create a map of what things are made of, at a microscopic level."

    "text": "The “Molecular Camera” for Any Surface\nImagine you could take a photograph of a slice of tissue, a leaf, or a painting, but instead of seeing colors, you see a map of hundreds of different molecules—fats, sugars, drugs, proteins—exactly where they are located.\nThat’s MSI. It’s a technique that combines the molecular identification power of a mass spectrometer with the spatial mapping of a microscope.\n\n\n\nThe Simple Analogy: The “Molecular Spray-Painter & Detective”\nThink of it like this:\n\nYou have a slice of something to analyze (e.g., a thin slice of a mouse brain, a plant leaf, or a cross-section of a pill).\nA very focused, tiny “probe” (often a laser or an ion beam) moves pixel-by-pixel across the sample, like the nozzle of an ultra-precise spray painter.\nAt each pixel, the probe “sprays off” (ionizes) a tiny bit of material from that exact spot, turning molecules into charged particles (ions).\nThese ions are then sucked into the mass spectrometer—the “detective”—which weighs each one with extreme precision to determine its mass-to-charge ratio (its molecular fingerprint).\nThe computer records which molecules were present at that exact (x, y) coordinate.\nAfter scanning every pixel, the software reconstructs all the data into images, where the brightness of a pixel shows how much of a specific molecule was present at that location.\n\n\n\n\nHow It Works (The 3-Step Process)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep\nName\nWhat Happens (Simply)\nReal-World Analogy\n\n\n\n\n1\nIonization\nA focused beam (laser/ion beam) hits a tiny spot, blasting molecules off the surface and giving them an electrical charge.\nA targeted water jet knocks a specific colored sand off a detailed mosaic, one tile at a time.\n\n\n2\nMass Analysis\nThe charged molecules (ions) fly through a mass spectrometer, which sorts and weighs them based on their mass and charge.\nA sophisticated wind tunnel that separates feathers, ping pong balls, and baseballs based on how fast they fly.\n\n\n3\nImage Creation\nA computer uses the location (x,y) of the probe and the list of molecules found there to create a map for each molecular weight.\nUsing a list of what sand color was found at each mosaic tile, you create a separate map for “all red tiles,” “all blue tiles,” etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Features & Why It’s Powerful\n\nLabel-Free: You don’t need dyes or tags to see the molecules. You discover what’s already there.\nMulti-Target: In a single experiment, you can generate images for hundreds or thousands of different molecules simultaneously.\nSpatially Resolved: It connects chemistry with location. You don’t just know a drug is in the liver; you know it’s concentrated in a specific region of a liver lobule.\nVersatile: Works on biological tissues, plants, pharmaceuticals, materials, and even historical artifacts.\n\n\n\n\nTypes of MSI (The Different “Probes”)\n\nMALDI-MSI: Uses a UV laser to knock molecules off a sample coated with a special matrix. Very common for proteins, peptides, and lipids in biology.\nDESI-MSI: Uses a charged spray of solvent (like a “molecular water jet”) at ambient pressure. Less damaging, great for drugs and metabolites.\nSIMS-MSI: Uses a beam of high-energy ions for extremely high spatial resolution (down to nanometers), ideal for elements and small molecules on surfaces.\n\n\n\nWhat Do the Results Look Like?\nYou get a gallery of images, each corresponding to a specific molecule. For a brain section, you might see: * Image 1: Distribution of a specific phospholipid (bright in the gray matter). * Image 2: Distribution of a neurotransmitter (bright in specific synaptic regions). * Image 3: Distribution of an administered drug (bright only in the tumor region).\n\n\n\nWhere Is It Used?\n\nDrug Development: Where does a new drug go in an organ? Is it reaching the tumor?\nCancer Research: What are the molecular differences between a tumor’s core and its edge?\nMetabolomics/Lipidomics: Mapping the complex chemistry of tissues in health and disease.\nToxicology: Where does a toxin accumulate in the liver or kidney?\nMicrobiology: How do molecules distribute in a bacterial colony?\nArt Conservation: Mapping pigments, binders, and degradation products in paintings without taking a sample.\n\nIn a nutshell: MSI is like Google Maps for molecules. Instead of seeing streets and parks, you see the precise location and abundance of chemicals, creating a visual guide to the molecular landscape of almost any surface."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The “Ultra-Specific Color Detective”\nImagine your eyes (or a regular camera) see the world in only 3 colors: Red, Green, and Blue (RGB). By mixing these, you can create millions of perceived colors, but you can’t see the specific “fingerprint” of light that makes a leaf, a mineral, or a painted pigment unique.\nHyperspectral Imaging (HSI) doesn’t just see 3 colors. It sees hundreds of extremely specific, narrow “colors” (wavelengths) of light, from the visible into the infrared. It captures the full spectral fingerprint of every pixel in an image.\n\n\n\nThe Core Analogy: The Advanced Spy Satellite vs. a Tourist Photo\n\nRGB Camera (Tourist Photo): Takes a picture of a forest. You see green trees, brown soil, and maybe a blue stream. You can guess what things are.\nHyperspectral Imager (Spy Satellite): Takes a picture of the same forest, but for each pixel, it records a detailed light spectrum. It can now identify not just “green,” but the exact spectral signature of pine vs. oak, detect stressed vegetation before it turns brown, find camouflaged objects, and identify the mineral composition of the soil. It knows what things are based on their chemistry.\n\n\n\n\nHow It Works: The “Data Cube”\nThis is the key concept. HSI creates a 3D data block called a “hypercube.”\n\nX & Y Axes: These are the spatial dimensions—just like a normal picture, they give you the location of each pixel.\nZ Axis (The Magic Dimension): This is the spectral dimension. For each pixel (x,y), instead of just 3 values (R,G,B), you have a full spectrum—a continuous curve showing how much light is reflected or emitted at hundreds of specific wavelengths.\n\n\nThink of it like this: For every tiny point in the image, you get a miniature graph of its light signature. The camera is essentially a scanner that takes a picture at every single color.\n\n\n\n\nThe Process in 3 Steps\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep\nWhat Happens\nSimple Analogy\n\n\n\n\n1. Scan\nThe sensor scans the scene, capturing light not in broad RGB channels, but across hundreds of narrow, adjacent wavelength bands (e.g., every 5 nm from 400 nm to 2500 nm).\nListening to a symphony not with 3 microphones (high, mid, low), but with 200 microphones, each tuned to a specific, narrow musical note.\n\n\n2. Record\nFor each pixel, it records the intensity of light at each wavelength, creating a unique spectral signature or “fingerprint.”\nGetting a detailed barcode for every pixel. A leaf, plastic, and concrete all have wildly different barcodes.\n\n\n3. Analyze & Map\nSpecial software compares these spectral fingerprints to known libraries. It then creates classification maps (e.g., “all pixels with the ‘sugar beet leaf’ signature are colored green; all with ‘plastic’ are red”).\nUsing a barcode scanner on every item in a warehouse to automatically sort them onto different maps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Superpowers of HSI\n\nSees the Invisible: It uses wavelengths beyond human vision (near-infrared, shortwave-infrared) where materials often have their most distinct signatures.\nNon-Contact & Non-Destructive: You just take a picture from a drone, plane, or in a lab. No touching or sampling needed.\nChemical Mapping: Because the spectral fingerprint is tied to molecular vibrations and electronic transitions, HSI is indirectly mapping chemistry and composition.\nQuantitative: It can measure concentrations (e.g., water content in a leaf, protein in grain).\n\n\n\n\nWhere Is It Used? (Real-World Examples)\n\nPrecision Agriculture & Drones: Detect crop disease weeks before the human eye can, measure water/nutrient stress, and map yield variability from the air.\nEnvironmental Monitoring: Map oil spills on water, identify invasive plant species, monitor mine tailings and soil contamination.\nFood Safety & Quality: Detect fecal contamination on poultry, measure fat/protein content in meat, sort plastics from organic waste in recycling.\nMedical & Surgical Guidance: In the operating room, HSI can visually map oxygen levels in tissue or identify cancerous margins in real-time, helping surgeons remove all the tumor.\nArt Conservation & Forensics: Reveal underdrawings in paintings, identify pigments non-invasively, and detect forged documents or counterfeit goods.\nPlanetary Science & Mining: NASA rovers use HSI to identify minerals on Mars. On Earth, it’s used for geological mapping and mineral exploration.\n\n\n\n\nHyperspectral vs. Multispectral\n\nMultispectral Imaging: Captures 5-15 broad bands of light (e.g., “red,” “near-infrared”). It’s like using a handful of colored filters. Good for specific, known tasks.\nHyperspectral Imaging: Captures 100-300+ very narrow, contiguous bands. It’s like using a prism to spread light into a full, continuous spectrum for each pixel. Powerful for discovery, identification, and complex analysis."
