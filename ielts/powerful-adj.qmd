### **How to Use This List for IELTS Success**

*   **For Speaking:** Don't try to memorize them all. Pick 5-10 of your favourites that feel natural to say and practice using them in your answers.
*   **For Writing (Task 2):** This is where you can really shine. Plan your essay and think about which key adjectives you can upgrade. For example, if you are writing about environmental problems, using "**detrimental**" instead of "very bad" or "**paramount**" instead of "very important" will impress the examiner.
*   **Don't Overdo It:** The goal is to sound natural and precise, not like you swallowed a thesaurus. Use these powerful words strategically for emphasis.

**Pro Tip:** Focus on learning words that are relevant to common IELTS topics like education, environment, technology, society, and health.
