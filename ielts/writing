Some people think young people should be required to have full time education until they are at least 18 years old. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

 - for those who want to pursue education further
 - for quality
 - those who wnat to do technical jobs may gradually start
 - To reach a certain level

I mostly agree with the statement.

Firstly, life has a lot of phases, which can, in my opinion, broadly be divided into two segments: stduy and work. In order to make the work part efficient and productive, one needs to be well-prepared. Also, I think, one should more carefully invest in time than in money. Consequently, at least 18 years of full time education is something that prepares a young mind to endeavor future challenges, both work immediately after or further education.

Furthermore, Education is called the backbone of a nation, and rightly so. At young age, people can be moulded as they are wished. And certainly, education is the thing with which they should me moulded and shaped. Unless this is made mandatory up to a certain age, these young brains have a high chance of being gone to dogs. Furthermore, to ensure quality education, I think students should be taught full time up to this age.

There is an aspect, however, on which I have a diverging opinion. Not all people aim to be involved in jobs requiring formal education. People interested in technical jobs, such as maintenance works at homes and offices, shoould be allowed to learn and work simulatenously, even before they are 18. This way, they can start preparing themselves for their career, engaging in practical tasks. Obviously, it should be ensured they recieve a certain level of schooling, so that the overall strcuture of the society does not fall apart.

Thus, while I mostly agree with the statement, there should be a relaxation for certain types of individuals. This would ensure a balance between quality education and technical jobs.
