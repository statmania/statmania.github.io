I am a **lecturer in statistics** at *Mymensingh Girls' Cadet College*, Mymensingh. Earlier I taught statistics at *Sylhet Cadet College* & *Pabna Cadet College*. Before joining Cadet College service, I was employed as a research assistant at *EAL*, Dhaka. I also worked as a science contributor for *The Daily Prothom Alo*.

I love to make my [tecahing slides](https://docs.statmania.info/lectures) using coding ([***10 of them***](https://docs.statmania.info)), also generating questions using **Python**, **Bash**, and **Latex**, among others, inside ***Rstudio***, or using [***Quarto***](https://quarto.org).

en **SIX science books**, which are all available on [Rokomari.com](https://www.rokomari.com/book/author/47631).
