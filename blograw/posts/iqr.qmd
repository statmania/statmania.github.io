The **Interquartile Range (IQR)** is a measure of statistical dispersion that describes the spread of the middle 50% of data. It is calculated as:

$\text{IQR} = Q_3 - Q_1$

where $Q_1$ is the 25th percentile and $Q_3$ is the 75th percentile.

### **Usefulness of IQR**

1. **Robust to outliers** – Unlike the range or standard deviation, the IQR is not influenced by extreme values.
2. **Identifies variability** of the central portion of the data.
3. **Used to detect outliers** – Often, values below $Q_1 - 1.5 \times \text{IQR}$ or above $Q_3 + 1.5 \times \text{IQR}$ are considered outliers.
4. **Helps in comparing distributions** – Especially when using box plots.

### **Example: Exam Scores**

Suppose the exam scores (out of 100) of 15 students are:

$55, 60, 65, 70, 72, 75, 78, 80, 82, 85, 88, 90, 95, 98, 99$

**Step 1: Find $Q_1$ and $Q_3$**
- $Q_1$ = median of the first half (excluding overall median if odd) = 70
- $Q_3$ = median of the second half = 90

**Step 2: Calculate IQR**

$\text{IQR} = 90 - 70 = 20$

**Step 3: Interpret**
- The middle 50% of students scored between 70 and 90.
- The spread of these central scores is 20 points.

**Step 4: Detect outliers**
Lower fence: $70 - 1.5 \times 20 = 40$
Upper fence: $90 + 1.5 \times 20 = 120$
No scores below 40 or above 120 → **No outliers**.

### **Why IQR is useful here**
- If one student scored 20 instead of 55, the **range** would change drastically, but the **IQR** would remain the same.
- IQR gives a clearer picture of the typical spread unaffected by extremes.
