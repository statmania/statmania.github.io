## Scenario: Testing a new button color

A website wants to compare:

* **Version A:** Blue button
* **Version B:** Red button

The outcome is **conversion** (1 = user clicked, 0 = did not click).

---

## Sample data

### **Group A (blue button)**

Users: 10
Clicks: **3**

So conversion rate:

$p_A = \frac{3}{10} = 0.30$

---

### **Group B (red button)**

Users: 10
Clicks: **6**

So conversion rate:

$p_B = \frac{6}{10} = 0.60$

---

## Step 1: State hypotheses

We want to know if B performs **better** than A.

$H_0: p_A = p_B$ (null hypothesis, which we don't expect/want to disprove)

$H_1: p_B > p_A$ (alternative hypothesis)

---

## Step 2: Pooled proportion

Because under $H_0$, both groups have the same conversion rate.

Total clicks = 3 + 6 = 9
Total users = 20

$p_{\text{pooled}} = \frac{9}{20}=0.45$

---

## Step 3: Standard error

$SE = \sqrt{p(1-p)\left(\frac{1}{n_A}+\frac{1}{n_B}\right)}$

$SE = \sqrt{0.45 \times 0.55 \times \left(\frac{1}{10}+\frac{1}{10}\right)}$

$= \sqrt{0.2475 \times 0.2} = \sqrt{0.0495} \approx 0.2225$

---

## Step 4: z-statistic

$z = \frac{p_B - p_A}{SE} = \frac{0.60 - 0.30}{0.2225} = \frac{0.30}{0.2225} \approx 1.35$

---

## Step 5: p-value

For a **one-sided test**, z = 1.35 → p ≈ **0.088**.

---

## Interpretation

* p-value = 0.088 > 0.05
* We **fail to reject** (H_0).
* **Evidence is suggestive but not strong enough** to conclude that the red button performs better.

### Business interpretation:

Even though conversion increased from **30% → 60%**, the sample is very small (only 10 per group), so the difference is not statistically significant at α = 0.05.

---

## What we *can* say

* B looks **promising**: a **+100% relative lift** in conversions.
* But the **sample size is too small** to be confident.
* A larger A/B test should be run.
