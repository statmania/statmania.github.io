Here’s a **clear, concise explanation** of **ARIMA**, **SARIMA**, and related models — followed by **minimal R examples**.

---

# **1. ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**

ARIMA is a time-series forecasting model used for **non-seasonal**, **univariate** data.
It is written as:

$\text{ARIMA}(p,d,q)$

### **Meaning of the parameters**

* **p** = number of autoregressive (AR) terms
* **d** = degree of differencing (to remove trend)
* **q** = number of moving average (MA) terms

### **When to use ARIMA**

Use ARIMA when your data:

* has **trend**, but
* **no seasonality**.

---

## Minimal ARIMA Example in R

```r
library(forecast)

# Use an example built-in dataset
ts_data <- AirPassengers[1:60]   # Monthly passengers (first 5 years)

# Fit a simple ARIMA model
fit <- auto.arima(ts_data)

# Print model
fit

# Forecast next 12 periods
forecast(fit, h = 12)
```

`auto.arima()` automatically selects (p, d, q).

---

# **2. SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)**

SARIMA extends ARIMA by adding **seasonal components**.

$\text{SARIMA}(p,d,q)(P,D,Q)_m$

Where:

* **P** = seasonal autoregressive order
* **D** = seasonal differencing
* **Q** = seasonal moving average
* **m** = seasonal period

  * Example: monthly data → m = 12
  * Quarterly data → m = 4

### **When to use SARIMA**

Use SARIMA when your time series has:

* **trend**,
* **and clear seasonality** (repeating yearly, quarterly, weekly pattern).

---

## Minimal SARIMA Example in R

```r
library(forecast)

ts_data <- AirPassengers  # strong yearly seasonality

# Fit SARIMA
fit <- auto.arima(ts_data, seasonal = TRUE)

fit
forecast(fit, h = 12)
```

---

# **3. ARIMAX / SARIMAX** (ARIMA with regressors)

These models include **external variables** (e.g., temperature, ads, price).
Useful when other predictors help forecast the main series.

```r
x <- rnorm(length(ts_data))   # Example external regressor
fit <- auto.arima(ts_data, xreg = x)
```

---

# **4. Seasonal decomposition (not a model)**

Often used to inspect data before ARIMA.

```r
plot(stl(AirPassengers, s.window = "periodic"))
```

Shows:

* trend,
* seasonal,
* remainder components.

# ⭐ Summary Table

| Model   | Handles Trend | Handles Seasonality | Includes External Variables |
| ------- | ------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------- |
| ARIMA   | ✔️            | ❌                   | ✔️ (ARIMAX)                 |
| SARIMA  | ✔️            | ✔️                  | ✔️ (SARIMAX)                |
| ETS     | ✔️            | ✔️                  | ❌                           |
| Prophet | ✔️            | ✔️                  | ✔️                          |

# **Very Small Example for Conceptual Understanding**

Suppose monthly sales:

| Month | Sales |
| ----- | ----- |
| Jan   | 100   |
| Feb   | 110   |
| Mar   | 120   |
| Apr   | 130   |
| May   | 140   |
| Jun   | 150   |

This has **trend but no seasonality** → ARIMA.

If you have:

| Month           | Sales |
| --------------- | ----- |
| Jan             | 100   |
| Feb             | 120   |
| Mar             | 150   |
| …               | …     |
| Jan (next year) | 110   |
| Feb (next year) | 130   |

This has **trend + yearly cycle** → SARIMA.
