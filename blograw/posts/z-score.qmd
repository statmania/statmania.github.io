A **z-score** (also known as a **standard score** or **z-value**) measures how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean of a distribution. It's a way of standardizing individual data points so they can be compared, regardless of the scale of the data.

### How to calculate the z-score:

The formula for the **z-score** of a data point is:

$z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}$

Where:

* $X$ = the value of the data point.
* $\mu$ = the mean (average) of the dataset.
* $\sigma$ = the standard deviation of the dataset.

### Steps to calculate the z-score:

1. **Find the mean** of the dataset.
2. **Find the standard deviation** of the dataset.
3. **Subtract the mean** from the data point you're interested in.
4. **Divide the result** by the standard deviation.

### Example:

Imagine you have the following dataset of test scores: [80, 85, 90, 95, 100]

* **Mean (μ)**: ((80 + 85 + 90 + 95 + 100) / 5 = 90)
* **Standard Deviation (σ)**: Calculate the standard deviation of the dataset (you could use a standard formula or a calculator for this).
  Let's say it’s **7.91**.
* To find the **z-score** for a score of **85**:

  $z = \frac{85 - 90}{7.91} \approx -0.63$

  This means the score of 85 is **0.63 standard deviations below the mean**.

### Common uses of the z-score:

1. **Standardizing data**:
   Z-scores are used to standardize data, especially when you want to compare values from different datasets with different units or scales.

2. **Identifying outliers**:
   A data point with a z-score greater than +3 or less than -3 is often considered an **outlier** because it lies more than 3 standard deviations away from the mean.

3. **Probability and normal distribution**:
   In statistics, z-scores are crucial when working with the **normal distribution**. They can be used to find the **probability** of a value occurring within a normal distribution by looking up the z-score in a standard normal distribution table (or using statistical software).

4. **Comparing scores across different distributions**:
   For example, in education, z-scores allow you to compare scores from different tests, even if those tests have different scales (e.g., SAT vs. ACT scores). You can convert raw scores into z-scores to compare relative performance.

5. **Risk assessment and finance**:
   In finance, z-scores can be used to assess the risk or financial stability of a company. The **Altman Z-score**, for instance, is used to predict the likelihood of bankruptcy.

6. **Quality control and manufacturing**:
   In quality control, z-scores help assess whether a product meets specifications, identifying whether the production process is consistent or if corrective action is needed.
