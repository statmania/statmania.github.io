## 1. What an interaction means (intuitive view)

An **interaction effect** means:

> The effect of one variable on the outcome depends on the level of another variable.

So, the relationship between $X_1$ and $Y$ **changes** depending on the value of $X_2$.

---

## 2. A simple regression without interaction

Say we model income as a function of gender and education:


$\text{Income} = \beta_0 + \beta_1(\text{Gender}) + \beta_2(\text{Education}) + \epsilon$

Here:

* $\beta_1$: average difference between males and females (assuming Gender is dummy coded, say Male=1, Female=0)
* $\beta_2$: effect of moving from one education level to another
* The two effects are **independent** — the gender gap is the same across all education levels.

---

## 3. Add an interaction term

Now we include a product term:

$\text{Income} = \beta_0 + \beta_1(\text{Gender}) + \beta_2(\text{Education}) + \beta_3(\text{Gender} \times \text{Education}) + \epsilon$

That last term — $\beta_3(\text{Gender} \times \text{Education})$ — is the **interaction**.

### Meaning:

It tells us whether the effect of education **differs by gender**.

* If $\beta_3 = 0$: no interaction — both genders gain equally from higher education.
* If $\beta_3 > 0$: the return to education (effect on income) is **greater for males** than females.
* If $\beta_3 < 0$: the return to education is **greater for females** than males.

## 4. Example with numbers

Suppose you fit this model (Gender=1 for Male, 0 for Female; Education=years of schooling):

$\text{Income} = 20{,}000 + 5{,}000(\text{Education}) + 3{,}000(\text{Gender}) + 1{,}000(\text{Gender} \times \text{Education})$

Interpretation:

| Term   | Meaning                                                                      |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 20,000 | Average income for a female with 0 years of education (baseline).            |
| 5,000  | Each year of education increases income by $5,000 for **females**.           |
| 3,000  | Males earn $3,000 more than females at 0 years of education.                 |
| 1,000  | For males, the effect of each additional year of education is $1,000 higher. |

So:

* For females: effect of education = 5,000 per year
* For males: effect of education = 5,000 + 1,000 = **6,000 per year**

That difference (1,000) is the **interaction effect**.

## 5. In general

Interactions can occur between:

* **Two categorical variables** (e.g., gender × marital status)
* **Categorical × continuous** (e.g., gender × education years)
* **Two continuous** (e.g., age × income in predicting health)

Each type changes the interpretation slightly — but the core idea is always:

> the slope (or effect) of one predictor depends on the value of another.
