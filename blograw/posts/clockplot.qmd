I am developing an R package, named clockplot. The primary goal of the clockplot is to plot event time on a clock chart. The length and color of the clock hands can be modified by certain qualitative and quantitative variables.

Additionally, the package can make a day chart, a week chart, or a month chart, or plan events in those periods.
I would like everyone to visit the package website (generated automatically by pkgdown), [explore the examples, and give wise advice](https://www.thinkermahmud.com/clockplot)

To see a quick example, see the attached plot. The plot shows times of earthquakes. Points are magnified as per magnitude. Length and color denote the depth of the epicenter.
