Not of terms between two numbers: $ n = +1, $ \\(\\text{nth term of arithmetic series = a + (n-1)d}\\) Geometric Growth: \\(P_n = P_o (1+r)^n\\) 2.1.2 Tips Recall and apply: Multiplying by a negative numbers changes the inequality sign. If \\(mn&lt;0, \\frac{kn+ml}{mn}&lt;mn \\Rightarrow kn+ml &gt; (mn)^2\\) When the GRE writes a root sign, the question writers are indicating a non-negative root only. SO \\(\\sqrt{16} = 4\\), not \\(\\pm 4\\). But if \\(x^2 = 16 \\Rightarrow x = \\pm 4\\) If \\(â€“3v &gt; 0 \\Rightarrow v &lt; 0\\) "]]
