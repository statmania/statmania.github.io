## Math Notes

### Formula

- Sum of an arithmetic series$S_n = \frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$, where $S_n$ is the sum of the first $n$ terms, $n$ is the number of terms, $a_1$ is the first term, and $a_n$ is the last term.
- Not of terms between two numbers: $ n = \frac{H-L}{d}+1, \text{H and L are highest and values, respectively, and d is common difference}$
- $\text{nth term of arithmetic series = a + (n-1)d}$
- Geometric Growth: $P_n = P_o (1+r)^n$

### Tips

- Recall and apply: Multiplying by a negative numbers changes the inequality sign. If $mn<0, \frac{kn+ml}{mn}<mn \Rightarrow kn+ml > (mn)^2$ 
- When the GRE writes a root sign, the question writers are indicating a non-negative root only. SO $\sqrt{16} = 4$, not $\pm 4$. But if $x^2 = 16 \Rightarrow x = \pm 4$
- If $â€“3v > 0 \Rightarrow v < 0$
